An accessible, live archive of "restored" (links and media fixed, etc) GeoCities pages, sorted by content type into "neighborhoods." **Eminently scrollable.**

It's a modern recreation of GeoCities! Wonderful, individual, personal websites are being created within the constraints of a limited platform once more! **Eminently scrollable.**
