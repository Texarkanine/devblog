	"GeoCities Gallery"

%}

An accessible, live archive of "restored" (links and media fixed, etc) GeoCities pages, sorted by content type into "neighborhoods." **Eminently scrollable.**

%}

It's a modern recreation of GeoCities! Wonderful, individual, personal websites are being created within the constraints of a limited platform once more! **Eminently scrollable.**

> The challenge is finding those websites because it's hard to have more in-depth searches on the Internet Archive, TheOldNet and Google doesn't have those pages cached anymore.

From [The Eric Experiment](https://ericexperiment.com/post/11-09-2021-oldavista) - an [AltaVista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaVista)-styled search engine to find old '90s and '00s pages. Most links go to their Wayback Machine pages.
