An accessible, live archive of "restored" (links and media fixed, etc.) GeoCities pages, sorted by content type into "neighborhoods." Most of the sites give off mid-90s aesthetics, even if their last updates were post-millennium.

**Eminently scrollable.**

It's a modern recreation of GeoCities! Wonderful, individual, personal websites are being created within the constraints of a limited platform once more! There are many sites evocative of the Golden Age of Web Design & into the late 2000s CSS breakout. They also tend to be densely interlinked so it's easy to explore and get that good old-fashioned `websurf` on!

**Eminently scrollable.**

> Discover the pioneers of the web: Embark on a historical journey to the earliest websites and the dawn of web design 1991–1995. 

A curated collection of **screenshots of the homepages** of a few of the major websites from a very narrow slice of time. Some names you'll recognize and marvel at how far they've come, others you won't recognize and will wonder where they went! Where possible, the Museum has linked to each site's homepage in subsequent years, so you can click through and see them change through time.

**Quintessential Pick:** [Microsoft in 1994](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/early-websites/microsoft-1994)

> The challenge is finding those websites because it's hard to have more in-depth searches on the Internet Archive, TheOldNet and Google doesn't have those pages cached anymore.

From [The Eric Experiment](https://ericexperiment.com/post/11-09-2021-oldavista) - an [AltaVista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaVista)-styled search engine to find old '90s and '00s pages. Most links go to their Wayback Machine pages.

Wiby seems to be good at finding currently-online pages that feel like they're from the early web even if their last update was this year. Some of them, though, truly are relics that somehow happen to be online and intact!
