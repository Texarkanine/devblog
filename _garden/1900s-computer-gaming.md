Flash **technically started** in the 1900s with [Flash 1 in 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash#Macromedia), and though it lasted through to 2020 it was being phased out long before that. Its heyday was really more of a 2000s thing. I built a ton of stuff on Macromedia Flash 5.

Wish you could still install the Flash Player and load the `.swf` files embedded in websites the way you used to? You can! Install Ruffle and your browser can play Flash content on websites again!

If your favorite Flash game's site isn't around to host it anymore, the Flashpoint Archive might have it. It captures a local Flash player inside a proxy of the requisite snapshot of the old internet so the `.swf`s run locally. You can download that stack and download games on-demand... or you can play all the old games fully offline by downloading the whole archive which was ~2.2 **terabytes** at the time this was written.
