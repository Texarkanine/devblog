I have planted a [digital garden](/garden/).

A digital garden is a curated collection of original content and hyperlinks that are of interest to the gardener. They're organized *somehow*, in a way that is meaningful to the gardener. Digital gardens, like physical gardens, are for wandering through, exploring, getting lost, and discovering.

If you were on the internet in the 1900s, you experienced this on the early web before the rise of monolithic multinational platforms.
If you missed it, perhaps you've ever browswed Wikipedia and clicked through link after link after link, ending up somewhere totally unrelated to your starting point... but connected. A digital garden is that experience writ small & with fewer rules. Opinions are allowed. There may or may not be "contribution standards." There may be multiple, a single, or no theme. Go for a walk and find out!
