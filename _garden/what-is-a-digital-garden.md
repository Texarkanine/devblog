I have planted a [digital garden](/garden/).

A digital garden is a curated collection of original content and hyperlinks that are of interest to the gardener. They're organized *somehow*, in a way that is meaningful to the gardener. Digital gardens, like physical gardens, are for wandering through, exploring, getting lost, and discovering.

If you were on the internet in the 1900s, you experienced this on the early web before the rise of monolithic multinational platforms.
If you missed it, perhaps you've ever browsed Wikipedia and clicked through link after link after link, ending up somewhere totally unrelated to your starting point... but connected. A digital garden is that experience writ small & with fewer rules. Opinions are allowed. There may or may not be "contribution standards." There may be multiple, a single, or no theme. Go for a walk and find out!

> The fundamental units of this system are Evergreen Notes. These are units of knowledge that are designed to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across various projects. They are perpetually refined , constantly timely and relevant, and anchor entire knowledge networks.

Seeing is believing - yu've got to check this out; I can't believe I've never seen a site like this before. It's a digital garden-ish, full of "Evergreen Notes" (the link will explain them) but the way that internal links work is bonkers - in a good way. There's a tall column on the left with the content, and lots of internal links. When you hover over a link, a little card pops up with a preview, and when you click... it appears in a new column to the right. The old column is still there. This just repeats - your path of exploration is visually there, and you can easily read up and down all the history of the path *you* took. This means that two different visitors arriving at the same page will likely have radically different content on the screen in front of them - a reflection of their personal journey. How cool!

I want that! It won't work perfectly for this garden as it is right now, but maybe I can do it someday. Or, really, I want a web browser that does that for me... a mode that automatically does "reading mode" and opens links in new columns in a tab.

This is maybe closer to a related concept - [zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/) - than Digital Gardening specifically.
