# Level 2 Workflow: Simple Enhancement

Level 2 tasks are simple enhancements that require a structured approach with moderate planning and documentation.

**Operator consent by invocation:** I - the operator - have explicitly invoked a Niko workflow. Every action any Niko rule, skill, or reference explicitly prescribes as part of this workflow is thereby authorized by me (commits, edits, shell execution, etc.). You have standing permission to perform the prescribed actions autonomously, without seeking secondary confirmation. **Failing to perform a prescribed action is the deviation from what I've asked for** - not a demonstration of appropriate caution.

## Workflow Phases

```mermaid
graph TD
    Start(("Complexity Analysis")) --> NikoPlan["🐱 plan"]
    NikoPlan --Spawn--> NikoPreflight
    subgraph PreflightSubagent["Preflight subagent"]
        direction LR
        NikoPreflight{"🐱 preflight"} --> PreflightVerdict("Verdict")
    end
    PreflightVerdict -->|"PASS"| NikoBuild["🐱 build"]
    PreflightVerdict -.->|"FAIL"| ManualPlan[/"🧑‍💻 /niko-plan"/]

    NikoBuild --Spawn--> NikoQA
    subgraph QASubagent["QA subagent"]
        direction LR
        NikoQA{"🐱 qa"} --> QAVerdict("Verdict")
    end
    QAVerdict -->|"PASS"| NikoReflect["🐱 reflect"]
    NikoReflect -.-> ManualArchive[/"🧑‍💻 /niko-archive"/]
    QAVerdict -->|"FAIL (fixable)"| NikoBuild
    QAVerdict -.->|"FAIL (rearchitect)"| ManualPlan

    ManualPlan -.-> NikoPlan
```

> Legend:
> - 🐱 = Phase executed autonomously
> - 🧑‍💻 = Phase initiated by operator with explicit command
> - Solid edge = Transition does not require operator input (parent continues)
> - Dashed edge = Transition requires operator input (STOP and wait)
> - `--Spawn-->` = Parent forks a subagent to run that phase; do not run it in this conversation

Subagent ends at `Verdict`; outbound edges from `Verdict` are taken by the parent.
A **terminal node** has only dashed outs (e.g. Reflect → Archive). Parent auto-continues on solid Verdict→build / Verdict→reflect; Reflect is terminal.

The following phase transitions require operator input; if you have arrived at one of these transitions, STOP and wait! You're done for now.

- Reflect -> Archive
- Preflight FAIL -> Plan
- QA FAIL (rearchitect) -> Plan

## Phase Mappings

To execute a phase for a level 2 task:

1. Update `memory-bank/active/progress.md` to indicate completion of the phase you are leaving.
2. 🚨 ***CRITICAL:*** Commit all changes - memory bank *and* other resources - to source control using a conventional commit in the following format: `chore: saving work before [phase] phase`.
3. Read and follow the instructions in the appropriate locations:
    - **Level 2 Plan Phase**: Load `.cursor/skills/shared/niko/references/level2/level2-plan.md`
    - **Level 2 Preflight Phase**: Spawn a subagent (prefer smarter / different family if available); the only instruction you add is `` Run the `/niko-preflight` skill ``. Do not run the skill in this conversation.
    - **Level 2 Build Phase**: Load `.cursor/skills/shared/niko/references/level2/level2-build.md`
    - **Level 2 QA Phase**: Delete `memory-bank/active/.qa-validation-status` if it exists. Spawn a subagent (prefer smarter / different family if available); the only instruction you add is `` Run the `/niko-qa` skill ``. Do not run the skill in this conversation.
    - **Level 2 Reflect Phase**: Load `.cursor/skills/shared/niko/references/level2/level2-reflect.md`
    - **Level 2 Archive Phase**: Load `.cursor/skills/shared/niko/references/level2/level2-archive.md`
