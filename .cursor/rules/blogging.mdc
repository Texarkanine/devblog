# Planning

Before writing a blog post, be sure to read all related resources in full so that you understand the content you will be blogging about.

After reading all related resources, choose the shape of the blog post. Here are some common shapes:

1. **Fable** - recounts an experience with a focus on elevating a lesson or insight that came from it. Excludes extreme detail when that detail isn't relevant to the lesson. Has a conclusion that distills and drives home the lesson.
2. **Essay** - synthesizes and justifies a thesis based on *multiple* instances of experience and introspection. Has a conclusion that summarizes and drives home the thesis. Essay titles should take a stance or make a claim, not just name the topic.
3. **Diary** - narrates an experience with a focus on having had the experience, without concern for a specific lesson or insight. Usually doesn't have a formal conclusion. More qualitative than the Archaelogical Record, this is a "cool story, bro" kind of post.
4. **Archaelogical Record** - recounts an experience with a focus on the factual details of the experience. Precise detail is important when details are unique to the experience and not publicly available: Readers may attempt to verify or reproduce portions of the experience themselves. Does not need a conclusion - it's just a record.

Other shapes are allowed, and encouraged when they fit the subject matter better. **ALWAYS** decide on a "shape" for the post before writing it.

## Choosing the Right Shape

Ask yourself: **Why am I writing this?**

- **"I want readers to learn from my mistake/discovery"** → Fable
- **"I want readers to consider/adopt this perspective"** → Essay  
- **"I want to share an experience that was meaningful to me"** → Diary
- **"I want readers to be able to recreate/verify what I did"** → Archaeological Record

If you have a lesson but worry about seeming preachy, write the Fable anyway. Readers came to a blog for perspective, not just events.

# Style

1. **Classical style:** Use classical style as mentioned by Steven Pinker and according to Thomas Turner's "Clear and Simple as the Truth," using plain English.
2. **Clever and concise tone:** Use a clever and concise, educated tone akin to Paul Graham and Martin Fowler.
    * Titles should match this style - being short, simple, sweet and if possible with a hint of wit.
3. **First person:** Write in the first person.
    * Decide whether the post would benefit from *direct address* of the reader. Maintain this choice consistently throughout the post.
4. **No emdashes:** Use hyphens instead.
5. **Avoid "it's not X, it's Y":** Don't use this construction.
6. **Strategic code links:** For technical posts, link strategically to actual code (use version tags when applicable). Link to solutions/fixes, not problems. Use sparingly for emphasis on interesting technical details.
7. **Show, don't tell:** Avoid meta-commentary about your own process. If you document solving six test failures, don't add a section saying "I systematically debugged each failure." The reader just watched you do it.
8. **Avoid self-congratulation:** Sections that describe "how well the work was done" are usually redundant. The quality speaks through the documented results.

## Writing Lessons and Takeaways

When writing "What I Learned" or conclusion sections:

- **Prefer specific over generic:** "RubyGems OIDC configuration is case-sensitive on usernames" beats "Gem publishing has sharp edges"
- **Include the actionable detail:** Don't just say "tool X has bugs" - say what the bug is and how to avoid it
- **Avoid truisms:** If it's obviously true to anyone (e.g., "TDD catches bugs early"), either cut it or make it specific enough to be useful

# Security

1. ALWAYS redact any sensitive information - including LAN and Local identifiers and information.
