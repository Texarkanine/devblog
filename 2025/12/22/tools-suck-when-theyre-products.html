They want the <em>result</em> of using the tool.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="different-lifecycles">Different Lifecycles</h2> <p>Tools become <em>dependencies</em> in people’s lives. If something goes wrong with a tool, the stuff downstream gets interrupted.</p> <p>Products - as used here - are leaf nodes, the “end of the line” - they’re where people want to be. If something goes wrong with a product, it can often be quite tolerable. Even if it’s not, they can just use a different product and nothing <em>downstream</em> of that has to change. The impact starts and ends with that single experience.</p> <p>If I want to watch a fun movie and I sit down at my TV and the movie I picked turns out to be really bad… well, that’s a <em>bad product</em>. I can always turn it off, or watch a fun show instead, or play a video game.</p> <p>If, however, I sit down and my <strong>TV</strong> doesn’t work, now I’m stuck. The product I wanted - the movie - isn’t even an option, <em>and neither are alternatives</em>. I can’t watch a different movie, nor watch a show, nor play a video game. My goal was <strong>dependent</strong> on the tool and when the tool fails it is much more disruptive than a simple “bad product” like a bad movie.</p> <h2 id="physical-products">“Physical” Products</h2> <p>Arguably, everything except leisure pursuits are tool uses. This is an important insight! Tool use is what humans do; we build tools to abstract processes so that we can get outcomes quicker, more reliably, and more efficiently.</p> <p>Refrigerators and microwaves make it really easy to get a warm meal. They’re tools. I <em>never</em> go to use my refrigerator solely for the joy of witnessing refrigeration. I go because I want something that it’s done for me - kept food fresh and cold. Maybe I pop it in the microwave to heat it up - not because I like watching electromagnetic radiation of that particular wavelength, but because I want a warm meal.</p> <p>This distinction is relatively easy to draw in the physical world. It can be less-obvious in the digital world.</p> <p>Your computer… is it a tool? Almost certainly, though the outcomes it offers are usually <em>themselves</em> tools too: you can run other pieces of software on it. Some will be games, which, if played for entertainment, would qualify as products. Inside the tool of a video player you might find the <em>product</em> of a movie. A web browser, though? That’s <em>another</em> layer of tooling, and if you load up an e-mail service, that’s <em>another</em> layer… Tools all the way down, until you <em>finally</em> get to the raison d’être of the tool: somewhere, a deep, buried <em>product</em> you want to <em>experience</em>.</p> <h2 id="the-siren-call-of-product-management">The Siren Call of Product Management</h2> <p>The techniques, processes, and dare I say, <em>tools</em> that are useful in building and delivering good products <em>also</em> work very well for getting digital artifacts out the door. Sometimes the artifact is indeed a product, like a movie, a video game, a book, song, etc.</p> <p>But sometimes it’s <em>not</em> - even though on the surface the following look and <em>can</em> be produced similarly:</p> <ul> <li>An executable file that, when launched, presents a video game</li> <li>An executable file that, when launched, presents a code editor</li> </ul> <p>The first is a product, and the second is a tool. After each one is initially released, the <em>ongoing</em> treatment that results in <em>continued success</em> is different.</p> <h3 id="products-forgive-change">Products Forgive Change</h3> <p>People like it when there are new products that are better. People especially like it if a product they already own gets better. In the world of leaf-node products, “better” is usually fairly clear-cut. The product has a purpose, and turning the knob up on how well it delivers, is better.</p> <p>You liked a funny movie? We released a new one that’s more of that, and also funnier. You like that song? We have a whole album of songs like it. You liked that video game? We fixed a bunch of bugs and improved the framerate. Clearly better.</p> <h3 id="tools-dont-forgive-change">Tools Don’t Forgive Change</h3> <p>Tools sit in the middle of people’s workflows. While many people may have many aspects of their workflows in common, there are many opportunities for personal preference and individual circumstances to enter the equation. So, a tool that’s “for X” may be used in significantly different ways by different people.</p> <p>Web Browsers are a great example: They’re a tool “for browsing the internet.” But one person might be big into browser-based games, and want a Flash plugin, WebGL support, Websockets, and GPU acceleration. A researcher at a university, though, would probably be much more concerned about compatibility with e-mail &amp; legacy academic systems, bookmarks (preserving and/or sharing across devices) and perhaps VPN support.</p> <p>Specific examples notwithstanding, web browsers’ single purpose (“browse the web”) belies a myriad of features and capabilities that result in no single pattern of use. It can be difficult to make a change to a browser that’s better <em>for everyone</em>. The more things a tool does, the greater the chance that any change at all will be a detriment to <em>someone</em>.</p> <blockquote class="link-card"> <h1>Hyrum's Law, or The Law of Implicit Interfaces</h1> <a href="https://kb.feval.ca/engineering/design/law-of-implicit-interface.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kb.feval.ca/engineering/design/law-of-implicit-interface.html</a> <small class="link-card-archive"> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251214040814/https://kb.feval.ca/engineering/design/law-of-implicit-interface.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">archive</a>) </small> </blockquote> <h2 id="what-to-do">What to Do?</h2> <p>So, when it comes time to spruce up the web browser (or other software tool) <em>product</em> and make a change… how do you do that nondisruptively?</p> <h3 id="option-0-let-them-eat-cake">Option 0: Let Them Eat Cake!</h3> <blockquote> <p>“No, it’s the users who are wrong!</p> </blockquote> <p>When someone is upset because of changes to a software tool, the peanut gallery often has responses ready:</p> <ul> <li>“the new website layout is different” <ul> <li>But it’s actually a better-thought-out design, see…</li> </ul> </li> <li>“they moved all the menu items around in the application I was using” <ul> <li>But they’re all still there, what’s the problem?</li> <li>Why not switch to (other similar software) if you hate it so much?</li> </ul> </li> <li>“they removed one (of the several hundred) of capabilities of this piece of software I was using” <ul> <li>But everything else is still there, that’s like 1% of what it does!</li> <li>Hardly anyone used that anyway, it’s better for the authors to stop spending time on it!</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>All of which miss the point - which may be understandable, as the complainers themselves may have been gaslit into engaging with the software as if it were a product offered to them, too!</p> <p>The <em>point</em> of all the complaints is</p> <blockquote> <p>I had been using this <strong>tool</strong> to achieve X, and now I have to go invest additional time and effort to figure out how to keep achieving the same old X.</p> </blockquote> <p>The changes impose a cost on the complainers that they have not budgeted for. Even if there is a real benefit to be had, <em>it wasn’t in the budget</em> of time and attention. That’s what they’re upset about.</p> <p>So, how <strong>do</strong> you make changes to a software tool without inconveniencing the people who use it?</p> <h3 id="option-1-just-dont">Option 1: Just Don’t</h3> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hyrum's Law</code>: Once you’ve got a tool out there and it’s got behaviors and features and buttons in places, people start building on top of those. If you shake up your “software product,” you risk toppling the things they’ve built. It’s just as absurd as breaking into a blacksmith’s workshop overnight and changing the shape and size of the anvil, tongs, and hammer. It doesn’t matter what you change them to, even if it’s an objectively better design - you’ve <em>interrupted</em> their workflow.</p> <p>That’s what software updates are to software tools. That sort of breaking-and-entering is usually infeasible and criminal in the real world but in the world of software, it’s easy and commonplace.</p> <h4 id="why-not-though">Why Not Though?</h4> <p>I said previously,</p> <blockquote> <p>The more things a tool does, the greater the chance that any change at all will be a detriment to <em>someone</em>.</p> </blockquote> <p>It’s also true that</p> <blockquote> <p>The more you change what a tool does, the greater the chance that you’ll entice a new user to use it.</p> </blockquote> <p>After all, if they weren’t already using it, maybe this new thing or change will make it appealing-enough for them to start! At least, that’s the Product and Marketing angle.</p> <p>When you combine these things, you burn a different set of users with each change, and pull in a new set of users with each change. If your tool was actually good-enough to attract users, a small burn from one nuisance change may not drive them away. Two such burns might not. But eventually, you’ll reach a tipping point.</p> <p>Because tools have such varying use-patterns, though, your first 10 changes aren’t all going to burn the same user 10 times - it will be distributed across your userbase. You’ll see new users show up for each of the 10 changes and very little churn, and then it’ll look like your <em>product</em> is improving! But then you’ll hit enough changes that you’ve burnt people enough that they start to leave. You make that 11th change and finally some people are fed up and leave. They’re replaced by new users who were enticed by that 11th change though, so it doesn’t look disastrous yet. But then you make the 12th change, and another set of users leave, hopefully replaced again.</p> <p>Now you’re in a stagnant holding pattern: to attract new users, you are used to making changes. Each change you make will push away a long-time user who has finally had enough, and pull in a new one. Now you’re not growing anymore. You’ve saturated the upheaveal threshold of your userbase and the techniques you had been using - <em>product development</em> - no longer work. You can do more of it, and it will just burn your resources without growth.</p> <h4 id="it-can-get-worse">It Can Get Worse</h4> <p>When products reach that stagnant holding pattern, they get desperate for revenue. It’s not available from growth anymore, so the inevitable happens…</p> <blockquote class="link-card"> <h1>Social Quitting - where 'enshittification' was coined</h1> <a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/social-quitting-1ce85b67b456" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doctorow.medium.com/social-quitting-1ce85b67b456</a> <small class="link-card-archive"> (<a href="https://archive.ph/uBvd9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">archive</a>) </small> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>When switching costs are high, services can be changed in ways that you dislike without losing your business.

They see people dissatisfied with their tool, abandoning it, and they apply the thumbscrews of enshittification. <strong>No</strong>. Nobody wants to use your tool. Nobody ever <em>wanted</em> to use your tool. They want to use your tool <em>for</em> something, and you’ve demonstrated that your tool is not reliable enough for that. That means your tool is useless.

Hold Their Hands</h4> <p>Plan to walk users through the changes - don’t just leave them to figure it out on their own. Have an interactive walkthrough that highlights major changes. It’s the <strong>changes</strong>, not the new features, that you need to call out.</p> <p>You can pitch your <em>new</em> features in marketing copy targeted at new users. You also need to offer to hand-hold your existing users through the <em>disruption</em> you’re introducing. These are two different audiences - do not forget that!</p> <h4 id="3-phased-rollout">3. Phased Rollout</h4> <p>Gradually introduce the change to users, giving them every opportunity to engage with the changes on <em>their</em> terms.</p> <ol> <li>
<strong>Deployed, opt-in.</strong> Users see a small <em>non-modal</em> notification about the change that invites them to try it. A banner across the top or something - something they can fully ignore with no consequences. Something that does <em>not</em> demand their attention when they opened the software tool to get something done. Clicking takes them to the walkthrough.</li> <li>
<strong>Deployed, opt-in.</strong> Users start receiving modal/pop-up notifications that the change will automatically apply after a given date. Clicking takes them to the walkthrough.</li> <li>
<strong>Deployed, opt-out.</strong> Users are greeted with the walkthrough when they first open the tool after the change from opt-in to opt-out. <strong>This</strong> walkthrough ends with an option to opt-out, with a reminder of the date after which the change will be permanent.</li> <li>
<strong>Fully deployed</strong>, old configuration is gone.</li> </ol> <p>You might be thinking that that sounds like a lot of work for what could be a small improvement or change to your tool. You would be right; see the first step above: You <strong>don’t ship minor changes to a tool</strong>. You let them stack up until the onslaught of change is worthy of your users actually context-switching into learning about it. That’s how you avoid creating a userbase that’s constantly annoyed by minor changes every time they use your tool.</p> <p>But also, once you build that <em>once</em> and integrate it with whatever feature-flag tech you’re using, the only real work is making that tutorial. And if you can’t be bothered to write documentation for your long-time users, your tool’s probably doomed regardless.</p> </article> <footer> <p> tagged: <a href="/tags/product-management/">product-management</a>, <a href="/tags/software-development/">software-development</a>, <a href="/tags/tools/">tools</a> </p> </footer> <p> <a href="/">~</a> / <a href="/all-posts.html">..</a> </p> </div> </main> <footer> <a href="/assets/img/bip47.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="call-me-bip-me-if-you-need-to-reach-me sponsor-link-light" aria-label="Support Me: BIP47 Payment Code"></a> <a href="/assets/img/bip47-dark.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="call-me-bip-me-if-you-need-to-reach-me sponsor-link-dark" aria-label="Support Me: BIP47 Payment Code"></a> </footer> </body> </html>
