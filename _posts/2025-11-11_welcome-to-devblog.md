This is the first post on this minimalist dev blog, built with Jekyll and automatically deployed via GitHub Actions.

## Why This Blog?

This blog serves as a playground for exploring:

- **Static site generation** with Jekyll
- **Custom CI/CD pipelines** using GitHub Actions
- **Tag-based organization** with the jekyll-archives plugin
- **Minimalist design** using the "no style, please" theme

## Technical Stack

The blog is powered by:
- Jekyll 4.3+ for static site generation
- GitHub Actions for automated builds and deployment
- The `jekyll-archives` plugin for automatic tag index pages
- Dual licensing: MIT for code, CC BY-SA 4.0 for content

## What's Next?

Future posts will dive into:
- Setting up custom Jekyll plugins
- Advanced GitHub Actions workflows
- Performance optimization for static sites
- Writing technical documentation
